# CSU33012-REST-API-Project
A repository for Software Engineering module, contains API implementation. this first part involves interrogating the Github API to retrieve data regarding the logged in developer

I will be using pygithub for the first part of this project, and will probaby using JavaScript for the visualisation aspect of this project. 
The first part was not too complex, but will probably be improved upon once the visualisation aspect comes into play.
